        <h2>skip if you don’t like intros</h2>
        <p>Few days back, I was tasked on a project. This app will be written in React. State management will be with Apollo with a backend in GraphQL. The way I learn new things is I do a very basic course to get the feel of it. I look for a free course, so that I can share it with the community. GraphQL being relatively new has fewer courses online. I did find a lot of resources both free and paid which I will review some day but this one course stands out. I have recommended this course to a lot many people I know.</strong></p>
        <h2>let’s talk about the courses</h2>
        <p>Netninja along with freeCodeCamp has come up with this amazing course. Here’s the link. It’s free. I have embed the entire playlist below, you can watch it right here.</p>
        <p>While this course covers a lot of ground, it misses few. Also, it is little bit outdated. Nonetheless, the course is still my favorite for beginners.</p>
        <p>pace is remarkably right, it’s neither too fast that you have to go back nor slow that you start doozing</p>
        <p>full screencast of code, I like where I don’t have to see someone’s face too much and the instructor explains things on codepad. So, this was a huge +</p>    
        <p>great example for the entire tutorial as it covers why GraphQL is an ideal solution. TODO apps wouldn’t do justice to the concepts of GQL.</p>    
        </p>
        <h5>FOR THE BACKEND</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Mutations</li>
            <li>Queries</li>
            <li>Resolvers</li>
            <li>GraphiQL</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>ON THE FRONTEND</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>query/mutation fire</li>
            <li>parameterized query</li>
            <li>composing multiple query</li>
            <li>refetching queries on mutation</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>after the course</h5>
        <p>As I said earlier, the course left a lot of grounds to cover. After you have done the basics you can learn about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>graphql subscriptions</li>
            <li>@client i.e. managing local state</li>
            <li>typescript support</li>
            <li>authentication/authorization in the app</li>
            <li>writing tests for graphql query/mutations</li>
            <li>paginated queries</li>
            <li>most important: using apolloclient as renderProps which is the current API being used in apollo’s documentation and everywhere in code.</li>
        </ul>
